# digital literary assignment-1
For this assignment, I used this web **https://standardebooks.org/** to download the book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".
The form of the book is "alices-adventures-in-wonderland_john-tenniel.epub", I moved it into **Google Drive** and opened it with **"cloud epub reader"**.
And then I took a screenshot using my computer and uploaded the PNG image to **Google Drive**.
I opened these PNG images using GDrive, and I cleaned the text and converted it into **Dillinger**.
Last but not least, I exported the file with ".md" and uploaded it to this repository on GitHub.
